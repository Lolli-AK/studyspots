# Badger Burrow

## Why Badger Burrow?
We are a group of underclassmen that created badger burrow to help fellow UW-Madison students find study spots. As our school grows, it becomes harder and harder to find a spot of your own. We're here to help!


## How it works
Badger Burrow will recommend a few nearby study spots for you on UW-campus! you can click map markers to look at specific locations within a building. Ideally, badger burrow will one day be able to ask you for your current location, find study spots based on your preferences in location or vibe, and take study spot submissions!

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- Flask
- SQLite
- Selenium
- Google Maps API

## Credits
We would like to give credit to dancingbannana on Reddit and their dedication to making education accessible to all Badgers. Without their inital [website](https://buckygrades.com/study/) and [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/11wrmr3/i_walked_4648_miles_through_every_building_on/), our project would not have been possible.
