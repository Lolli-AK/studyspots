            <h2>why badger burrow?!</h2>

            <p>
                we are a group of underclassmen that created badger burrow to help fellow UW-Madison students
                find cute study spots. as our school grows, it becomes harder and harder to find a spot of your own.
                we're here to help!
            </p>

            <h2>how it works</h2>

            <p>
                badger burrow will ask you for your current location. upon receiving your location, it will then recommend a few nearby study spots for you!
                ideally, badger burrow will one day be able to find study spots based on your preferences in location or vibe!
